Presentation Layer / Front End
========================================

When choosing a framework, or a library in most of the cases we look at the performance, maturity, and support this is where ReactJs
was a benefit to us and used in our HLExplorer front end.

Why ReactJs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Plainness
   - Component-based approach
			- Use of well-defined lifecycle
			- JavaScript makes React very simple to learn, build professional web.
			- Use of a special syntax called JSX that allows to mix HTML with JavaScript.
- Data Binding
   - One-way data binding, control of the flow of data to components through the dispatcher, a one control point.
- Performance
   - React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI.
- Testing
   - Easy to test, rich set of libraries, like Jest, and React Testing Library
- Straightforward to learn
   -  Easily understand React knowing JavaScript, and the good part: for react you just need basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
