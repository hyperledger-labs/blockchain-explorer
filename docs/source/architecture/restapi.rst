REST API
===========================================

The Hyperledger Explorer REST API provides endpoints to retrieve information, and metrics about the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain,
such as blocks, transactions, nodes, chaincodes, channels, peers, and other information.

The REST API is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime, and uses built-in middleware function in Express to parse incoming
requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.

Security on the Hyperledger Explorer REST API is enforced with a token. All requests made to the REST API must have a token that is generated by the API.
