Introduction
============

`Hyperledger Explorer <https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/explorer>`__ is a tool for visualizing blockchain operations of the `Hyperledger Fabric <https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric>`__ platform.
It is the first ever blockchain explorer for permissioned ledgers, allowing anyone to explore the distributed ledger projects being created by
Hyperledger's members from the inside, without compromising their privacy.
The project was contributed by DTCC, Intel, and IBM.
The ability to visualize data is of critical importance, in order to extract business value from it. Hyperledger Explorer provides this much needed
functionality.
