## First Major Release

 - Hyperledger Explorer seeks graduation from the incubation phase

    - A project’s maintainers seeking to publish a project’s first major release (see semver) must seek approval of the TSC whether in Active or Incubation status as defined above. While it is expected that most projects will have reached an Active status by the time their maintainers seek to announce a first major release, the TSC may approve such requests also in cases where the project is still in Incubation status, should the TSC believe that the project's code is sufficiently mature.
