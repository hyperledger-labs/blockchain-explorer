## Hyperledger Explorewr Project Lifecycle

- Hyperledger Explorer Project follows the Hyperledger Project lifecycle states process as follows:

   - [Proposal](proposal.md)

   - [Incubation](incubation.md)

   - [Active](active.md)

   - [First Major Release](first-major-release.md)

   - [Deprecated](deprecated.md)

   - [End of Life](end-of-life.md)

Projects may not necessarily move through those states in a linear way and may go through several iterations.
