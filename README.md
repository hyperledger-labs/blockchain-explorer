## Requirements

Following are the software dependencies required to install and run hyperledger explorer
* nodejs 6.9.x (Note that v7.x is not yet supported)
* PostgreSQL 9.5 or greater

Hyperledger Explorer works with Hyperledger Fabric 1.0.  Install the following software dependencies to manage fabric network.
* docker 17.06.2-ce [https://www.docker.com/community-edition]
* docker-compose 1.14.0 [https://docs.docker.com/compose/]

## Clone Repository

Clone this repository to get the latest using the following command.

- `git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer.git`.
- `cd blockchain-explorer`.

## Database setup

Connect to PostgreSQL database.

- `sudo -u postgres psql`

Run create database script.

- `\i app/db/explorerpg.sql`
- `\i app/db/updatepg.sql`

Run db status commands.

- `\l` view created fabricexplorer database
- `\d` view created tables

## Fabric network setup

 Setup your own network using [Build your network](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html) tutorial from Fabric. Once you setup the network, please modify the values in `config.json` accordingly.

## Running hyperledger-explorer

On another terminal.

- `cd blockchain-explorer`
- Modify config.json to update network-config.
	- Change "fabric-path" to your fabric network path,
	example: "/home/user1/workspace/fabric-samples" for the following keys: "tls_cacerts", "key", "cert".
	- Final path for key "tls_cacerts" will be:  "/home/user1/workspace/fabric-samples/first-network/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt".

- Modify config.json to update one of the channel
	- pg host, username, password details.
```json
 "channel": "mychannel",
 "pg": {
		"host": "127.0.0.1",
		"port": "5432",
		"database": "fabricexplorer",
		"username": "hppoc",
		"passwd": "password"
	}
```

If you are connecting to a non TLS fabric peer, please modify the
protocol (`grpcs->grpc`) and port (`9051-> 9050`) in the peer url and remove the `tls_cacerts`. Depending on this key, the application decides whether to go TLS or non TLS route.

## Build Hyperledger Explorer

On another terminal.

- `cd blockchain-explorer`
- `npm install`
- `cd blockchain-explorer/app/test`
- `npm install`
- `npm run test`
- `cd client/`
- `npm install`
- `npm test -- -u --coverage`
- `npm run build`

## Run Hyperledger Explorer

From new terminal.

- `cd blockchain-explorer/`
- `./start.sh`  (it will have the backend up).
- `tail -f log.log` (view log)
- Launch the URL http://localhost:8080 on a browser.
