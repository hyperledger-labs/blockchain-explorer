#   This is a configuration file for the fabric-ca-server command.
#
#   COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
#   ------------------------------------------------
#   Each configuration element can be overridden via command line
#   arguments or environment variables.  The precedence for determining
#   the value of each element is as follows:
#   1) command line argument
#      Examples:
#      a) --port 443
#         To set the listening port
#      b) --ca.keyfile ../mykey.pem
#         To set the "keyfile" element in the "ca" section below;
#         note the '.' separator character.
#   2) environment variable
#      Examples:
#      a) FABRIC_CA_SERVER_PORT=443
#         To set the listening port
#      b) FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE="../mykey.pem"
#         To set the "keyfile" element in the "ca" section below;
#         note the '_' separator character.
#   3) configuration file
#   4) default value (if there is one)
#      All default values are shown beside each element below.
#
#   FILE NAME ELEMENTS
#   ------------------
#   The value of all fields whose name ends with "file" or "files" are
#   name or names of other files.
#   For example, see "tls.certfile" and "tls.clientauth.certfiles".
#   The value of each of these fields can be a simple filename, a
#   relative path, or an absolute path.  If the value is not an
#   absolute path, it is interpretted as being relative to the location
#   of this configuration file.

#  The registry section controls how the fabric-ca-server does two things:
#  1) authenticates enrollment requests which contain a username and password
#     (also known as an enrollment ID and secret).
#  2) once authenticated, retrieves the identity's attribute names and
#     values which the fabric-ca-server optionally puts into TCerts
#     which it issues for transacting on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
#     These attributes are useful for making access control decisions in
#     chaincode.
#  There are two main configuration options:
#  1) The fabric-ca-server is the registry.
#     This is true if "ldap.enabled" in the ldap section below is false.
#  2) An LDAP server is the registry, in which case the fabric-ca-server
#     calls the LDAP server to perform these tasks.
#     This is true if "ldap.enabled" in the ldap section below is true,
#     which means this "registry" section is ignored.

      # values which are each a distinguished name (i.e. a DN). For simplicity, assume the
      # values of the 'member' attribute are 'dn1', 'dn2', and 'dn3'.
      # Further assume the following configuration.
      #    converters:
      #       - name: hf.Registrar.Roles

      # The value of the user's 'hf.Registrar.Roles' attribute is then computed to be
      # "peer,client,dn3".  This is because the value of 'attr("member")' is
      # "dn1,dn2,dn3", and the call to 'map' with a 2nd argument of
      # "group" replaces "dn1" with "peer" and "dn2" with "client".

#  the default expiration ("expiry" field) is "43800h" which is 5 years in hours.
#  Note that "isca" is true, meaning that it issues a CA certificate.
#  A maxpathlen of 0 means that the intermediate CA cannot issue other

#  (See RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.9)

#  The expiration for the root CA certificate is configured with the

#  The pathlength field is used to limit CA certificate hierarchy as described

#  Examples:
#  1) No pathlength value means no limit is requested.
#  2) pathlength == 1 means a limit of 1 is requested which is the default for
#     a root CA.  This means the root CA can issue intermediate CA certificates,
#     but these intermediate CAs may not in turn issue other CA certificates
#     though they can still issue end entity certificates.
#  3) pathlength == 0 means a limit of 0 is requested;
#     this is the default for an intermediate CA, which means it can not issue

# Multi CA section
#
# Each Fabric CA server contains one CA by default.  This section is used
# to configure multiple CAs in a single server.
#
# 1) --cacount <number-of-CAs>
# Automatically generate <number-of-CAs> non-default CAs.  The names of these
# additional CAs are "ca1", "ca2", ... "caN", where "N" is <number-of-CAs>
# This is particularly useful in a development environment to quickly set up
# multiple CAs. Note that, this config option is not applicable to intermediate CA server
# i.e., Fabric CA server that is started with intermediate.parentserver.url config
# option (-u command line option)
#
# 2) --cafiles <CA-config-files>
# For each CA config file in the list, generate a separate signing CA.  Each CA
# config file in this list MAY contain all of the same elements as are found in
# the server config file except port, debug, and tls sections.
#
# Examples:
# fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw --cacount 2
#
# fabric-ca-server start -b admin:adminpw --cafiles ca/ca1/fabric-ca-server-config.yaml
# --cafiles ca/ca2/fabric-ca-server-config.yaml

# Intermediate CA section
#
# The relationship between servers and CAs is as follows:
#   1) A single server process may contain or function as one or more CAs.
#      This is configured by the "Multi CA section" above.
#   2) Each CA is either a root CA or an intermediate CA.
#   3) Each intermediate CA has a parent CA which is either a root CA or another intermediate CA.
#
# This section pertains to configuration of #2 and #3.
# If the "intermediate.parentserver.url" property is set,
# then this is an intermediate CA with the specified parent
# CA.
#
# parentserver section
#    url - The URL of the parent server
#    caname - Name of the CA to enroll within the server
#
# enrollment section used to enroll intermediate CA with parent CA
#    profile - Name of the signing profile to use in issuing the certificate
#    label - Label to use in HSM operations
#
# tls section for secure socket connection
#   certfiles - PEM-encoded list of trusted root certificate files
#   client:
#     certfile - PEM-encoded certificate file for when client authentication
#     is enabled on server
