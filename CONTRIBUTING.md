# Contributing to Hyperledger Explorer

We welcome contributions to the Hyperledger Explorer Project in many forms like bug reports, feature requests,  documentation updates, code.


## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

We track all bugs and feature requests on [Hyperledger Explorer Jira](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/BE/issues). Please send a detailed bug report with relevant logs and steps to reproduce the issue when you encounter an issue. We always appreciate such bug reports as it reduces our effort and will help us fix the bug easily. Please use the search functionality to ensure that the bug/feature request you are trying to file doesn't not exist already. If it exists, you can always add addition information to the JIRA issue in the comments sections and start watching for updates. All the issue here will be added to our backlog and prioritized in the upcoming sprints.

You can contact the developers for any general problems or questions on [Hyperledger Chat](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/blockchain-explorer).
